- Subjects offered in each semester.
- _Grades of students_ in quizzes, assignments, midterm, and final exams.



# Grade Weightage in Character Grade & Grade Points (G)

80-84 - A-
75-79 - B
70-74 - B-
65-69 - C+
60-64 - C

So `create.cpp` creates this data file which holds all the details about students, subjects, and their marks. `read.cpp` reads this data file and process it to calculate the grades and GPA of each student.
